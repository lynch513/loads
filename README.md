# loads

A Clojure library designed to ... calculate loads on city power electric stations

## Usage

First install leiningen util:

[https://leiningen.org/](https://leiningen.org/)

At now moment you can local install and use this library. In near future I will add this library to clojars.org ...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lynch513/loads.git
lein deps
lein install
```

After local installation you can include and use this library: 

```clj
;; project.clj
  ...
  :dependencies [...
                 [org.clojars.lynch/loads   "0.1.6-SNAPSHOT"]]
  ...
```

See examples in my project: [https://github.com/lynch513/loads-web](https://github.com/lynch513/loads-web)
